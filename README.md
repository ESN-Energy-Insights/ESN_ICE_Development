## Workflow

### 1. Issue/Change Needed
- Identify an issue or change that needs to be addressed.
- Ensure the issue is documented with all necessary details and links to relevant code sections.

### 2. Move Issue to "In Progress"
- Move the issue card from the **"To Do"** section to **"In Progress"** on the project board.
- This indicates that work has started on the issue.

### 3. Create a New Branch
- Create a new branch off of the `master` branch.
- Use the following naming convention:  company_Issue:issueNumber_date
- Example: `BlueRidge_Issue:1234_2024-10-09`

### 4. Make Changes to Code
- Modify the relevant codebase as required by the issue.
- Ensure that all changes are thoroughly tested and meet the projectâ€™s code standards.

### 5. Create a Merge Request
- Once changes are completed, create a **Merge Request (MR)** into the `master` branch.
- Include details about the changes and reference the issue in the MR description.
- Upload any necessary files and exported views related to the issue.

### 6. Review Process
- Your Merge Request will be reviewed by a team member.
- If **approved**, the branch will be merged into `master` and deleted.
- If **denied**, you will receive a summary of the issues that need to be addressed, and the code will **not** be merged into `master`.
